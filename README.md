# Async-std's waker_set.rs

This crate is just the waker set from [async_std::sync::waker_set](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/master/src/sync/waker_set.rs), which I couldn't find in a standalone crate.

If upstream updates, please file an issue or PR here. All other issues and PRs should go to async-std.
